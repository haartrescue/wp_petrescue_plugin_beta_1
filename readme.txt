Add the PetRescue API Functionality to any WordPress installation with the Find a Pet and Pet Info shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin uses the PetRescue API functionality to import the rescue organisation's animals into a WordPress Post or Page.

It uses the PetRescue API Key and Group ID of the rescue to display pets for adoption using the shortcodes:

* [petrescue_find_a_pet] - Brings all pets for the group into a list
* [petrescue_find_a_pet category="dog"] - Brings all dogs for the group into a list
* [petrescue_find_a_pet category="cat"] - Brings all cats for the group into a list
* [petrescue_find_a_pet category="other"] - Brings all other animals for the group into a list (Other than Cats and Dogs)
* [petrescue_pet_info] - This shortcode is added to a single page and is used for displaying any animal on the site in it's own page.
* [petrescue_pet_info petid="12345"] - Brings the single pet info into a page based on the PetID (PetRescue listing number)

### Features: ###

* Settings page to enter you PetRescue API Key and Group ID
* Choose the page for the Find a Pet and Pet Info on the settings page, meaning you can format anything you like before and after the shortcode
